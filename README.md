# BikeIndia Bike Sharing Demand Prediction Project

## Background:
BikeIndia is a bike-sharing system that aims to provide convenient access to bikes for short-term use. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, BikeIndia faced revenue declines and aims to develop a strategic plan to boost revenue post-quarantine. To achieve this, they seek to analyze post-quarantine demand for shared bikes nationwide.

## Objective:
The objective of this project is to create a predictive model that forecasts the demand for shared bikes based on various influencing factors. By understanding customer needs post-pandemic, BikeIndia aims to adjust its business strategy and differentiate itself from competitors.

## Dataset:
The dataset contains daily bike demand data across the American market, focusing on various influencing factors such as season, weather, temperature, humidity, and more.

## Solution Deliverables:
1. **Dataset Information:** Overview of dataset structure, including columns, data types, and categorical variables.
2. **Data Quality Check:** Detection and handling of null, duplicate, and missing values.
3. **Data Cleaning:** Pre-processing of data to prepare it for model training.
4. **Feature Selection:** Identification and removal of redundant or unwanted features.
5. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualization of numerical and categorical values, correlation analysis.
6. **Feature Rescaling:** Standardization or normalization of features if required.
7. **Model Implementation:** Implementation of simple and multiple linear regression models.
8. **Evaluation Metrics:** Evaluation of model performance using appropriate metrics.
9. **Final Results:** Key findings from EDA and model evaluation, insights for decision-making.
