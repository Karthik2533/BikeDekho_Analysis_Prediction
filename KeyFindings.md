- Visualization revealed some valuable insights into bike demand patterns.
- Eg: How bike demand varies across the seasons, months, weekdays, or weather condition, and also helped us to know the correlation between bike demand and features.

# Model Evaluation-
- evaluated the model by computing MSE, RMSE, R2, for both simple and Multiple Linear Regression model.

# Recommendations based on the Analysis

- feature Importance:
    - feature has shown stroong correlation with bike demand which says that temperature has a high impact on bike usage.
- Model Selection:
    - The multiple linear regression model was better than simple linear regression model in terms of MSE and RMSE. This indicates that considering multiple features provides a better prediction than considering a single feature.
- Buisness Strategy:
    - From the insights gained Bike India can optimize bike availability and marketing strategy based on weather conditions, seasons, and other factors which impacts bike demand
    - These kind of predictive analysis and demand forecast will help the business to enhance operational efficieny and customer satisfaction.
- Further Analysis:
    - These recommendations will help the business to understand that they should focus more on user preferences, customer demographics, and external factors such as marketing campaigns according to the weather and seasons, and events to refine predictive models and improve decision making.
